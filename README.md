## 🔍 What This Project Is About

I took a retail dataset and explored it from different angles — sales, profit, discounts, regions, customer segments, etc.  
Using Power BI and Tableau, I built dashboards that made it easier to spot trends and patterns you normally miss in raw data.

This repo collects:

- All the charts and visuals  
- Short explanations of what each visualization shows  
- Final insights and takeaways  
- Links to the full dashboards and Medium article

## 📁 Dataset Used

**Global Store Dataset**  
Contains order details like:

- Order ID  
- Sales  
- Quantity  
- Profit  
- Discount

**Insight:**  
Sales and quantity follow a similar pattern throughout the year. Some months jump sharply due to seasonality.


### 💸 Discount vs Sales

**Insight:**  
When discounts go up, sales also increase — classic retail behavior. Useful for planning promotions.

## 📝 Summary of What I Found

- More discount usually means more sales  
- Central region performs the best  
- California and New York contribute the most to total revenue  
- Consumer segment brings in strong consistent profit across months
